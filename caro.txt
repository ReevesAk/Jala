Communication is considered the oil and wheel to the society. Discuss

What is commnuication?
Before we delve into details as to the importance of commuication to us, I want to point out rhe meaning of communication.
Communication is the imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium. In other words this very thesis I am writing is an effective medium of commuinicating with my reader(s).

Communication is basically the way to connect to other people. Had the people been able to communicate to their fullest, there wouldn't be any reason for conflicts or disagreements in the society. And this is largely supported by what Christopher Morley, an American journalist and novelist wrote, ““Any problem, big or small, within a family, always seems to start with bad communication. Someone isn’t listening.”

Society is formed by the people who come together and share their feelings and interests with one another and this is only possible through communicating.

A society is made up of a group of people, families, who live in a or occupy a certian geographical location. Patrick Lencioni, an American writer of books on business management particularly in relation to team managemen once stated “ I think for any relationship to be successful, there needs to be loving communication, appreciation, and understanding.” His carefully chosen words resoantes with the fact that many conflicts today arise from miscommunication and could well have been avoided if communication was appropriated.

A well-worn saying by the Lou Rawls, “Communication – the human connection – is the key to personal and career success.” This couldn’t be more true as communication is vital in all aspects of our life: education, sports, secular activities, homes, offices, etc.
